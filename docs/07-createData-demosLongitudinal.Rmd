## Calculate Population Change
In addition to the crime rates, we also want to add a measure of how population numbers changed from year to year (i.e. lagged population).

```{r lagged-pop}
crime %>%
  mutate(pop_delta = pop-lag(pop, order_by = year)) %>%
  mutate(pop_delta_pct = pop_delta/lag(pop, order_by = year)*100) %>%
  select(year, pop, pop_delta, pop_delta_pct, everything()) -> crime
```
